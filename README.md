# OpenLaval

This program fill calculate Supersonic Impulse Turbine Blade Design

Required parameters are Specific heat ratio and inlet Mach numbers

Licence are written in the file.

# Usage
Write the necessary parameters in the setting.ini file and save it before executing the following

```
python openLaval.py
```

Results are saved in the result folder.

# Reference
This program was based on below papers
1. NACA RM L52B06, APPLICATION OF SUPERSONIC VORTEX-FLOW THEORY TO THE DESIGN OF SUPERSONIC IMPULSE COMPRESSOROR TURBINE-BLADE SECTIONS
2. DESIGN OF TURBINE BLADES SUITABLE FOR SUPERSONIC RELATIVE INLET VELOCITIES AND THE INVESTIGATION OF THEIR PERFORMANCE IN CASCADES:	PART I-THEORY AND DESIGN
3. DESIGN OF TURBINE BLADES SUITABLE FOR SUPERSONIC RELATIVE INLET VELOCITIES AND THE INVESTIGATION OF THEIR PERFORMANCE IN CASCADES:	PART 11-EXPERIMENTS, RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

5. NASA TN D-4422, ANALYTICAL INVESTIGATION OF SUPERSONIC TURBOMACHINERY BLADING: II - Analysis of Impulse Turbine-Blade Sections

# Done
1. Characteristic lines can be drown
2. Inlet Mach number and Gas Cp are taken in account to generate turbine blade
3. Leading Edge Cutoff partially done

# Future works
1. Asymetry Blade
2. Evaluation Function Enrichment (Function are there but seems invalid yet)

of cource with constant bug fix
